# clean architecture android
Made this project as a part of the course that I recently did at caster.io
1. Programming language used is kotlin.
2. Architecture components like Room ORM for local data persistence and ViewModel are used
3. Retrofit for network requests, Dagger 2 for Dependency Injection and RxJava for asynchronous operations
4. Test cases are written using Robolectric, Mockito and Espresso.
